The initial mode of the calendar.    
Default value: 'month'
* showEventDetail    
If set to true, when selecting the date in the month view, the events happened on that day will be shown below.    
Default value: true
* startingDayMonth    
Control month view starting from which day.    
Default value: 0
* startingDayWeek    
Control week view starting from which day.    
Default value: 0
* allDayLabel    
The text displayed in the allDay column header.    
Default value: ‘all day’
* noEventsLabel    
The text displayed when there’s no event on the selected date in month view.    
Default value: ‘No Events’
* eventSource    
The data source of the calendar, when the eventSource is set, the view will be updated accordingly.    
Default value: null    
The format of the eventSource is described in the EventSource section
* queryMode    
If queryMode is set to 'local', when the range or mode is changed, the calendar will use the already bound eventSource to update the view    
If queryMode is set to 'remote', when the range or mode is changed, the calendar will trigger a callback function rangeChanged.    
Users will need to implement their custom loading data logic in this function, and fill it into the eventSource. The eventSource is watched, so the view will be updated once the eventSource is changed.    
Default value: 'local'
* step    
It can be set to 15 or 30, so that the event can be displayed at more accurate position in weekview or dayview.
* rangeChanged    
The callback function triggered when the range or mode is changed if the queryMode is set to 'remote'

        $scope.rangeChanged = function (startTime, endTime) {
            Events.query({startTime: startTime, endTime: endTime}, function(events){
                $scope.eventSource=events;
            });
        };

* eventSelected    
The callback function triggered when an event is clicked

        <calendar ... event-selected="onEventSelected(event)"></calendar>
    
    
        $scope.onEventSelected = function (event) {
            console.log(event.title);
        };

* timeSelected    
The callback function triggered when a date is selected in the monthview. If there's no event at the selected time, the events parameter will be either undefined or empty array

        <calendar ... time-selected="onTimeSelected(selectedTime, events)"></calendar>
        
        $scope.onTimeSelected = function (selectedTime, events) {
            console.log('Selected time: ' + selectedTime + ', hasEvents: ' + (events !== undefined && events.length !== 0));
        };

* titleChanged    
The callback function triggered when the view title is changed

        <calendar ... title-changed="onViewTitleChanged(title)”></calendar>
        
        $scope.onViewTitleChanged = function (title) {
            $scope.viewTitle = title;
        };

# EventSource

EventSource is an array of event object which contains at least below fields:

* title
* startTime    
If allDay is set to true, the startTime has to be as a UTC date which time is set to 0:00 AM, because in an allDay event, only the date is considered, the exact time or timezone doesn't matter.    
For example, if an allDay event starting from 2014-05-09, then startTime is

        var startTime = new Date(Date.UTC(2014, 4, 8));

* endTime    
If allDay is set to true, the startTime has to be as a UTC date which time is set to 0:00 AM, because in an allDay event, only the date is considered, the exact time or timezone doesn't matter.    
For example, if an allDay event ending to 2014-05-10, then endTime is

        var endTime = new Date(Date.UTC(2014, 4, 9));

* allDay    
Indicates the event is allDay event or regular event

* className    
Type: String, This will add the passed classes on the Event elements. (Applicable only on Week & Day views)

**Note**
In the current version, the calendar controller only watches for the eventSource reference as it's the least expensive.
That means only you manually reassign the eventSource value, the controller get notified, and this is usually fit to the scenario when the range is changed, you load a new data set from the backend.
In case you want to manually insert/remove/update the element in the eventSource array, you can call broadcast the 'eventSourceChanged' event to notify the controller manually.

# Events

* changeDate    
When receiving this event, the calendar will move the current view to previous or next range.  
Parameter: direction  
1 - Forward  
-1 - Backward

        $scope.$broadcast('changeDate', 1);

* eventSourceChanged    
This event is only needed when you manually modify the element in the eventSource array.  
Parameter: value  
The whole event source object

        $scope.$broadcast('eventSourceChanged',$scope.eventSource);

# i18n support
When including the angular locale script, the viewTitle and header of the calendar will be translated to local language automatically.

        <script src="http://code.angularjs.org/1.4.3/i18n/angular-locale_xx.js"></script>
